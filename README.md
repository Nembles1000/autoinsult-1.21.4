## DESCRIPTION ##
This isn't supposed to be a serious mod, I made it as a learning project.
When the user is playing in a Minecraft multiplayer world, the mod detects player deaths within a customizable range (default is 64 blocks).
When the player death event occurs within range, the mod choses an insult from a list and sends it in chat (as the user).

## HOW TO USE ##
To use the mod you have to build the .jar file from the source code (using gradle).
To actually run the mod, you need Fabric and Fabric API (preferably latest version) and Minecraft 1.21.4

## KNOWN PROBLEMS AND FLAWS ##
The AutoInsult mod can only work in multiplayer servers that disable Signed Chat (servers that run the NoChatReports mod).
The mod, in case of death, also insults the user (I plan on fixing this).

## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
Note that the use of this mod in multiplayer servers might offend players or get the user banned, depending on the rules of said server.
The insult list, named "DEATH_MESSAGES", can be modified by the user to suit better his needs.
